"1. County geography changes over time. New counties are created and old counties are deleted or their boundaries are modified."

"Census 2010 geography."
"2. Wade Hampton Census Area, AK (02270) was renamed to Kusilvak Census Area, AK (02158) effective July 1, 2015. This change was"
"made retroactive in the data to the year 1990."
